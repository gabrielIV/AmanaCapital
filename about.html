                Amana Capital Limited has been licensed and regulated by the
                Capital Markets Authority as a Fund Manager since 2003 and by
                the Retirement Benefits Authority since 2004. We manage money on
                behalf of individuals, families and corporate organizations. All
                the assets under our management are kept under a safe custody
                arrangement by a custodian bank licenced as such by the CMA. In
                this way, in the unlikely event that Amana Capital was to go out
                of business, all our client assets are safe. There is absolutely
                no co-mingling of our own funds with the funds that we manage.

              In November 2004, Amana Capital was also registered with the
              Retirement Benefits Authority as a manager of retirement benefit
              schemes and has remained a licencee of the RBA since then. Towards
              the close of 2005, the company re-branded to Amana Capital
              Limited, in recognition of the need to re-position the company
              appropriately. In 2006 we launched “MyPension”, the Amana Personal
              Pension Plan, a first by a fund manager in Kenya. In 2010 we
              launched the Amana Unit Trust Funds Scheme specifically targeted
              at investors of moderate means with the lowest account opening
              balance in Kenya at the time In 2011 we launched the Amana
              Umbrella Pension Scheme, the first group pension scheme sponsored
              by a fund manager in Kenya targeting small & medium size
              enterprises In 2012 Wilken Africa Limited, a 50-year old Kenyan

                  <b>OUR INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY</b>
                </h2>

                <p>
                  Our investment philosophy is governed by three principles;
                  Quality, Consistency and Specialization. Every investment
                  decision we make should pass the QCS test
                </p>

                <div class="my-5">
                  <p><b>QUALITY</b></p>
                  <p>
                    Quality embodies elements of: Process, system, continual
                    improvement, factual and Customer centric. Quality underpins
                    our investment processes in their entirety. We do not seek
                    ultra-high returns from compromising the quality of the
                    investment we make. Quality being our philosophy our
                    investments are always customer focused, this leads us to
                    research and understand our customer needs and expectations
                    and tailor investments solutions accordingly. Our
                    investments follow a systematic process and are not
                    reactionary but well managed and defined to obtain the
                    desired results. We focus on facts when making decisions on
                    what to invest in or de-invest in. We continually review our
                    processes for improvement. The sum totality of quality is we
                    are able to effectively manage variations to expectations
                    and not expose our client’s funds to unmanageable,
                    unexpected and excessive risk.

                    The by product of one of our investment philosophies,
                    quality, is Consistency. Being a systematic process-oriented
                    investment driven fund manager, we aim at providing our
                    clients with consistent returns. We don’t seek to be in the
                    lower percentile neither in the upper percentile, we seek on
                    maintaining moderate risk adjusted returns consistently. The
                    natural result of this is that our clients will enjoy long
                    term cumulative returns to their investment which eventually
                    will be above market standards but of a higher quality.

                  <p>
                    For us to achieve quality and consistency, we have to must
                    our trade and one of the processes for us to master out
                    trade is specialization. We invest in the banking,
                    insurance, telecom, energy and IT sectors. We horn our
                    skills and knowledge in these sectors and gain in-depth
                    understanding of how they function, what drives companies
                    that are in those sectors. On the fixed income side of the
                    business we look at 5-10-year tenures. We focus on the
                    African market and seek to invest in the continent.
                    Specialization also helps us invest our client’s funds in
                    the right mix. Through specialization we will be able to
                    have superior knowledge of companies and not relay on market
                    timing and economic guessing investment methods.
